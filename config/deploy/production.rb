# server list. The second argument is a, or duck-types, Hash and is
# used to set extended properties on the server.

server 'habitat.monkee-boy.com', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{web}

set :deploy_to, '/var/www/monkee-boy.com/www' # Should be _ or www depending on redirects.
set :deploy_env, 'production'
